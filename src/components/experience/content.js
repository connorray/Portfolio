      experienceName: "Amazon Software Engineer II (Dec 2023-June 2024)",
      experienceDesc:
        "Part of the Measurement, Analytics, and Data Science team, where I tackled both backend and frontend challenges. My work ranged from debugging big data pipelines with Spark on EMR to building UIs for internal account managers. I utilized a broad tech stack, including ReactJS, Java + Spring, Spark SQL, and various AWS services (Sagemaker, EMR, Lambda, Athena, Redshift, DynamoDB, API Gateway). A key project involved creating a solution using react-helmet and custom event listeners for injecting microfrontends, aiding in the deprecation of Twitch widgets. Additionally, I worked on productionizing ML recommendation systems and building infrastructure, focusing on ML Ops.",
