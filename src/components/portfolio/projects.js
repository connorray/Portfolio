        "This was the final project for my graduate artificial intelligence course where I created both a 2 layer neural network and a basic K-Means classification agent to recolor the second half of a gray scale image based on the colored first half of it. Both K-Means clustering and the neural network were coded from scratch in order to understand both techniques better as a supplement to the course material.",

I was able to conduct a small scale original research project inpsired by the work on HER and Prioritized experience replay in order to convert the Atari game Motezum'as Revenge into a goal based environment for goal based learning for the solution of the sparse reward problem in DRL. This model was able to achieve better rewards than the baseline DQN as was hypothesized and is a good stepping stone for future work.",
